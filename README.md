Impact of Covid on Student’s Education

Research Topic:
Perception of Indian Students on the impact of online learning on their studies because of Covid-19.

Research Problem:
Determine the effect of different external factors on the concentration level of students in studies in an online learning environment.

This research project delves into the perception of Indian students regarding the impact of online learning due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Focusing on the effect of various external factors on student concentration during online classes, the study aims to determine if factors such as place of residence, gender, annual parental income, internet connectivity, and living conditions influence students' academic focus. Conducted through a survey of 50 students across different institutions, the analysis employed Chi-Square and ANOVA tests at a 90% confidence level. By investigating these factors, we seek to gain insights into the challenges and dynamics of the online learning environment, offering valuable perspectives for educational stakeholders.
